## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

This app is designed to pull data from various news apis, and store that information in a ready state so the client app can pull the data with the maximum of speed.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

For the back end:
1. MySQL Server [Mac](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484914)/[Windows](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/file/?id=484919)
2. [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)
3. A terminal, such as Powershell or Git Bash
4. A MySQL manager, such as MySQL Workbench (optional)
5. A code editor, such as VS Code or Atom (optional)

### Installing

1. Start by acquiring the repo, by either clicking the download button, or running `git clone https://github.com/Sudolphus/NewsGator.Solution`
2. You'll also need MySQL Server and .NET Framework installed (linked above)
3. Once .NET is installed, navigate into the NewsGator directory in your terminal of choice and acquire the necessary packages with `dotnet restore`
4. Install the schema for holding article data. If you have MySQL Workbench or similar, you can import the schema from the included `gator.sql` file. Otherwise, you'll have to enter it manually to MySqlServer.
5. You'll need to set up an EnvironmentalVariables.cs file to hold your password. You'll need to include your MySql Server password. You'll also need to get api keys for [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/docs/get-started) and the [New York Times](https://developer.nytimes.com/). Then, create the file like this:
```
namespace NewsGator.Models
{
  public static class EnvironmentalVariables
  {
    public static string SqlPassword { get; } = (Your MySQL Server Password);
    public static string NewsApiKey { get; } = (Your News API Key);
    public static string NewYorkTimesKey { get; } = (Your New York Times Key);
  }
}
```
Place this file in the NewsGator/Models folder.

6. You can then build the project with `dotnet build`, or run the project directly with `dotnet run`.
7. Once the project is run, you can open it with the browser (dotnet run should make it available on localhost:5000 by default). There should then be various buttons, which will query the api in question and add the information to the database.
8. For the front end, navigate into the the newsgator_client directory, and build the project, with `npm start` or `npm build`. Build will create a production build in the bin/ folder, which you can open in a brower, and npm start should open your browser to the relevant page automatically (localhost:3000 by default).
9. The front end requires the back end to be running in order to make the api calls; when first loading, it should grab the top stories automatically, and then display them. The Archive page should allow you to make a more detailed api call, including results from before the previous day, if you've run the back end api call on more than one day so that there is previous data to display.


## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Some tests for the backend are included in the NewsGator.Tests folder. To run, them, navigate into the NewsGator.Tests directory and run `dotnet test`. These tests should handle the constructors on the classes needed to standardize the API call results for consistent storage.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

To use the back end, start the project as listed above, then you can load up the project in your browser by navigating to localhost:5000. You should see some buttons that will then execute the queries and display the results.
